## Orb Moves: How to use
Simply import these 5 move effects, and condense the various orb moves into only 5 move slots! 
You can then replace the existing orb moves! (the ones you don't intend to keep)
Some orb effects have been changed! (see One-Shot, Lob, Rocky)

## Notes by Gelius
Rocky Orb is included, but it will deal Typeless Damage (It usually deals Rock Type Damage). If you wanna keep the proper typing, you will have to use the usual Rocky Orb Move ID (Which is Rock Tomb, which means you'll have to preserve Rock Tomb).

You don't need to edit the move the Rainy, Sandy, Hail, Sunny, Evasion, Rocky and Snatch Orb call, if you are preserving these move IDs.

If you include Ally Switch in your Rom, you don't need to edit the move Switcher Orb calls.

Lob Orb is included with a different effect and range. If you wish to keep the original Orb effect and range, what you can do is make it call Quick Attack instead (So long you don't mind Normal Type Damage over Typeless Damage).

All-Mach Orb is in technicality the only Orb Move you need to maintain, as it targets all allies in the floor.

For all Line of Sight Orbs: You will need to set a projectile for them. To do this, go to Lists > Animations > Moves > (Select Here Move Slot you have Line of Sight on) > Anim 4 ID and select whatever Animation for Projectile you want. You may wanna consult other orbs to do this. I'd recommend either Switcher or Shocker as a basis.

Foe-Hold is included in this patch, but its been made into a Petrify Orb clone. If you want the actual range of All Enemies on the Floor, you will have to preserve the Foe-Hold move.

This patch will free up about 30 or so Moves for you to use in whatever manner you wish to.
