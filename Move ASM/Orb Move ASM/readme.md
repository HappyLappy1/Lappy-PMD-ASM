## Orb Moves: How to use

Rocky Orb is included, but it will deal Typeless Damage (It usually deals Rock Type Damage). If you wanna keep the proper typing, you will have to use the usual Rocky Orb Move ID (Which is Rock Tomb) (Meaning you'll have to preserve Rock Tomb)
You don't need to edit the move the Rainy, Sandy, Hail, Sunny, Evasion, Rocky and Snatch Orb call, if you are preserving these move ids
If you include Ally Switch in your rom, you don't need to edit the move Switcher Orb calls
Lob Orb is included with a different effect i believe. If you wish to keep the original Orb effect, what you can do is make it call Quick Attack instead.
All-Mach Orb is in technicality the only Orb Move you need to maintain, as it targets all allies in the floor.
For all Line of Sight Orbs: You will need to set a projectile for them. To do this, go to Lists > Animations > Moves > (Select Here Move Slot you have Line of Sight on) > Anim 4 ID and select whatever Animation for Projectile you want. You may wanna consult other orbs to do this. I'd recommend either Switcher or Shocker as a basis.
Foe-Hold is included in this patch, but its been made into a Petrify Orb clone. If you want the actual range of All Enemies on the Floor, you will have to preserve that move slot.

Regardless, this will give you about 30ish move slots for you to do whatever the hell you want with them
